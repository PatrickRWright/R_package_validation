"Reading secuTrial data into R statistics ",3,"### Test objectives: 

**Test whether secuTrial data exports can be loaded into R with the use of the `read_secuTrial_raw()` function.**  

* This is tested with the suggested export options which are:
   - zipped, English, reference values stored in a separate table, contain Add-IDs, contain centre information, contain form status, contain project setup, not rectangular  
* And the following variations thereof:
  - ISO, CSV format for MS Excel

**Test whether secuTrial data exports violating the necessary export options fail to load.**  
* This is tested with the following variations form the suggested export options:
  - rectangular export
  - UTF-16
