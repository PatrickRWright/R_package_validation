# R package validation plan - Custom built software

## Specification

Every functionality needs:
 - to be defined as a very briefly written high level **user requirement**
 - to be defined as a more technically written **functional specification**
 - to be technically tested and the **tests** need to be described

## Versioning

All user requirements, functional specifications and tests need to be compiled into individual version controlled documents (one per class).

## Risk assessment

Risks are assessed for all functional specifications based on the following method.

Classify: (High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1)  
**Severity** - How detrimental is a failure of the assessed functionality?  
**Probability** - How likely is a failure of the assessed functionality?  
**Detectability** - How quickly will a failure of the assesed functionality be detected?
