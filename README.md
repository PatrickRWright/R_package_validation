# R package validation plan

## Specification

Every functionality needs:
 - to be defined as a very briefly written high level **user requirement**
 - to be defined as a more technically written **functional specification**
 - to be technically tested and the **tests** need to be described

## Versioning

All user requirements, functional specifications and tests need to be compiled into individual version controlled documents (one per class).

## Risk assessment

Risks are assessed for all functional specifications based on the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) method.
